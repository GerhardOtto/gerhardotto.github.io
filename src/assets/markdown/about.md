Full-Stack Software Engineer passionate about solving technical challenges by improving or expanding my existing knowledge base. I am driven by the economic value of reliable software, focusing on building high quality systems that drive efficiency and long term business growth.

I built this portfolio site as a quick reference for my track record. It's powered by Astro, which allows me to use different frameworks, so naturally most components are built with React. One of the cool things about this site is its reusability: all the text comes from markdown files. It was designed to be simple yet easy to update. If I want to add another education entry or work experience, I just add a markdown file with the required metadata and content, and the existing logic handles the rest.
