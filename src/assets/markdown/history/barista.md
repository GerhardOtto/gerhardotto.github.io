I thoroughly enjoyed working as a Barista, it prepared me for work in no way any module at university could have.
It taught me how to deal with customers, work with colleagues and interact with management.
But perhaps most important of all how to make and !make a good cup of coffee and well... that I am not very good at multitasking.
