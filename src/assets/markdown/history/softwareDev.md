I communicate with designers, developers, and external teams to align on feature requirements and implementations, improving communication between technical and non-technical teams to reduce development friction.

So far I have learned to adapt to ensure the job gets done, whether that means picking up a new framework, stepping in to debug infrastructure issues, or venturing into completely uncharted territory. This has strengthened my ability to learn on the fly, prioritize effectively in fast-changing environments, and develop a problem-solving mindset to ensure things get done.

Tech Stack:
- Go
- gRPC
- MongoDB
- Next.js
- GCP
