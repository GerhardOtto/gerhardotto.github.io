Working as a full-stack software engineer at a startup taught me to adapt to what is required to ensure the job gets done, whether that means picking up a new framework, stepping in to debug infrastructure issues, or collaborating closely with non-technical teammates. 
This experience strengthened my ability to learn on the fly, prioritize effectively in fast-changing environments. It strengthen my problem-solving mindset for when the path forward isnâ€™t clearly defined.

Tech Stack:
- Go
- gRPC
- MongoDB
- Next.js
- GCP
